The main trade-off I observed is that SIC POVM provides informational completeness in a single measurement setting, but reconstruction becomes more sensitive to shot noise compared to separate Pauli-basis measurements."

        "The reconstructed density matrices closely match the ground-truth matrices for all three representative states. The bar heights and phase patterns are visually consistent in both plots, which agrees with the numerical metrics (fidelity ≈ 1 and trace distance ≈ 0). This is expected because the experiments were run in an ideal simulator without noise, meaning the SIC POVM linear-inversion workflow is able to recover the true state exactly. In Task-5, I will repeat this analysis under finite-shot and noisy conditions to study how reconstruction performance changes in more realistic settings."

        "The main source of reconstruction error in this experiment is finite-shot sampling noise, since SIC POVM probabilities are estimated from a limited number of measurement shots. This noise mainly affects the off-diagonal coherence terms, which is why the Hadamard-basis states show slightly lower fidelity than the computational-basis states. The ideal simulator runs produced fidelity ≈ 1, confirming that the reconstruction method itself is correct and the deviations are due to sampling variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "As mitigation, I tested increasing the shot count and observed a clear improvement in reconstruction fidelity, especially for coherence-heavy states. In future work, I plan to explore maximum-likelihood reconstruction and noise-channel modeling to further stabilize tomography under realistic conditions."
